# This is COMP 7409A Group 12's project:
## Members: Li Chentao, Liu Yutong, Zheng Wenjing, Zhou Yuen, Xu Yunshi

#### For this repo we're planning to have:

* Codebase & dataset:
>Since github cannot hold large csv files, everyone should download dataset on their own computer in following link:
>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022?select=Variant+II.csv
* Report
>Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1REfFCZOKR-V5SowUwqwtFaTH1IJR-R0uF8IKbXkIH9I/edit

* Presentation & Graph


## Workflow:
### *Begin:
> Everyone who has an idea or wants to implement a model should make a branch from main and start work from there. ( Preferably name your branch with your model/feature's name.)
### *After you've done with your branch:
> 1. swich to main branch (git checkout main)
> 2. Pull from main (git pull)
> 3. swich to your branch (git checkout your_branch_name)
> 4. Merge local main branch into your branch (git merge main)
> 5. Resolve code conflict from main (if there's any) and commit & push to your branch
> 6. Open a pull reqeust from github page, describe your branch and assign a person to check your code
> 7. After checking out pull request, the assignee should approve the pull request with review
### *After pull request is merged, we will have a more powerful main branch (Hopefully :\)

# If you met any problem at any point, do not hesitate to ask in Wechat or open an ISSUE on github, it is never a shame to ask questions!
