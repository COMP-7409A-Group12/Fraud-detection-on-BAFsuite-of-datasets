# Project

## This is COMP 7409A Group 12's project:
### Members: Li Chentao, Liu Yutong, Zheng Wenjing, Zhou Yuen, Xu Yunshi

#### For this repo we plan to have:

>Codebase & dataset


>Report


>Presentation & Graph

## Workflow:
### *Begin:
> Everyone who has an idea or wants to implement a model should make a branch from main and start work from there. ( Preferably name your branch with your model/feature's name.)
### *After you've done with your branch:
> 1. swich to main branch (git checkout main)
> 2. Pull from main (git pull)
> 3. swich to your branch (git checkout your_branch_name)
> 4. Merge local main branch into your branch (git merge main)
> 5. Resolve code conflict from main (if there's any) and commit & push to your branch
> 6. Open a pull reqeust from github page, describe your branch and assign a person to check your code
> 7. After checking out pull request, the assignee should approve the pull request with review
### *After pull request is merged, we know have a powerful main branch (Hopefully :\)

## If you met any problem at any point, do not hesitate to ask in Wechat or open an ISSUE on github, __it is never a shame to ask questions__ !
